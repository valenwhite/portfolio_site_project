# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a software developer.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd portfolio`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the project: `npm start`

## Features

- **About Me**: A section about myself, my skills, and my experiences.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my projects with links to the live sites and the source code.
- **Contact**: A form to reach out to me.

The portofolio uses your Github useranme to both dispaly the sidebar correctly and produce the porfolio items. If you were to use this for yourself you'd need to alter the username variable found in the profile component (portfolo -> components -> Profile -> Profile.js). you'll also need to update the resume page as that has been hard coded for now.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- CSS
- Unsplash API

## Future Improvements

- Add more projects as I create them.
- Implement a blog section to share my thoughts on software development.
